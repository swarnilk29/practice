1. what is IP Address ?
- An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numeric label assigned to each device connected to the internet or a local network. It acts like a digital "home address" for your device, allowing other devices to find and communicate with it. Without IP addresses, the internet couldn't function because devices wouldn't be able to locate each other. 


2. What is DNS ?
- DNS (Domain Name System) is the "phone book" of the internet, translating human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into the numerical IP addresses (like 142.250.190.14) that computers use to communicate. Without DNS, you would have to remember and use IP addresses every time you wanted to visit a website, which would be very difficult.

3. what is API ?
- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and share data. Think of it as a way for two separate programs to interact and exchange information, like a waiter taking your order at a restaurant and bringing it to the chef. APIs enable developers to build applications without having to recreate features that already exist, saving time and effort. 

4. What is CRUD ?
- CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four fundamental operations used to manage data in databases and applications. These operations allow users to manipulate data, including adding new entries, viewing existing ones, modifying data, and removing entries. 

5. what is GET, POST, PATCH & DELETE ?
- In web development, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are HTTP methods used for interacting with servers and managing resources. GET retrieves data, POST creates new resources, PUT replaces existing resources, PATCH partially updates them, and DELETE removes resources. 

GET / users - fetch a list of users
POST / users - create a new user
PUT / users/{id} - update an existing user
DELETE / users - delete all users
DELETE / users/{id} - delete a specific user

6. what is resquest and response ?
- a request is a message sent from a client (like an app or web browser) to a server requesting data or action. A response is the server's reply to that request, containing the data or confirmation of the action. Essentially, requests are the questions, and responses are the answers in this digital conversation. 

7. what is Bearer Token ?
- A bearer token is a string of text, often generated by a server, that acts as a credential for authentication and authorization. It grants access to a resource to whoever possesses the token, similar to having a key that unlocks a door. 

8. what is JWT ?
- A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard way to securely transmit information between parties, often used for authentication and authorization in web applications. It's essentially a compact, self-contained JSON object that carries claims (information) about the user or the application's request. 

9. what is the differance between HTTP & HTTPS ? 
- The main difference between HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is security. HTTP transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and potential misuse, while HTTPS encrypts the data using TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), ensuring a more secure and private connection. 

10. What is GraphQL and why is it used?
- GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that gives API clients exactly the data they requested. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call.

11. what is restful API ?
- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a type of API that follows the architectural principles of REST, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. It's designed to be simple, stateless, and use a uniform interface, making it ideal for web services and mobile app development

12. CODES and there meanings ->
- 200 (OK) - the server has successfully processed a request and returned the requested data
- 201 (Created) - the server has successfully created a new resource
- 400 (Bad Request) - the server cannot or will not process the request due to a client error
- 404 (Not Found) - the server cannot find the requested resource
- 500 (Internal Server Error) - Something went wrong on the server's side

13. what is JSON ? 
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

JSON FORMAT -
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Leanne Graham",
    "username": "Bret",
    "email": "leanne@gmai.com"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Howell",
    "username": "Jane",
    "email":"jane@gmail.com"
}
